Project: 0x07(Pointers, Arrays & Strings)

0-memset: A function that fills memory with a constant byte.
This function takes a pointer s to the memory area to be filled, 
a constant byte b, and an unsigned integer n specifying the number of bytes to fill.
It then uses a for loop to iterate over the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s,
setting each byte to the value of b. Finally, it returns a pointer to the memory area s.

1-memcpy.c: A function that copies memory area.
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Returns a pointer to dest
