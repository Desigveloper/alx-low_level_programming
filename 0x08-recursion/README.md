Project: 0x08(recursions)

0-puts-recursion.c: A function that prints a string followed by a newline recursively.
This function takes a pointer s to the string to be printed. It uses recursion to print
each character of the string one by one, until it reaches the null terminator character '\0'.
It prints a newline character '\n' using putchar() when the null terminator is encountered and returns.
