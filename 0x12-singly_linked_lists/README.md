Project 0x12: C - Singly linked lists

0-print_list.c: A function that takes a pointer to the head of a singly linked list as its argument
and prints out each element of the list using a while loop.
If the str member of a node is NULL, it prints out [%d] (nil), where %d is the length of the string;
otherwise, it prints out [%d] %s\n, where %d is the length of the string and %s is the string itself.
It then returns the number of nodes in the list.

1-list_len.c: A function that takes a pointer to the head of a singly linked list as its argument
and counts the number of nodes in the list using a while loop.
It then returns it once all nodes have been counted.
