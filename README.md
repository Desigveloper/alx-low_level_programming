ALX LOW_LEVEL_PROGRAMMING

This is the repository for my first programming language.
The repo contains all ALX projects on C language

C is one of the most important and widely used of all programming languages. It is a powerful language that can be used not only to build general-purpose applications but also to write “low-level” programs that interact very closely with the computer hardware.
